        Welcome to an online user study on personalized news recommendation
        algorithms. The purpose of this study is to test different
        personalization techniques to gather insight into what works best in a
        real world scenario. This study is part of a master's thesis at the
        University of Bergen. No privacy information is collected, just your
        answers.
      </p>
      <p>The survey consists of three main steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choosing your preferred sports genres.</li>
        <li>
          Selecting articles within these genres that best match your news
          preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Answering a questionnaire about which article recommendations you find
          most relevant.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Click the "Next" button at the bottom of the screen to progress through
        each step. If the button is disabled, then the progress criteria have
        not been met, i.e. more answers are needed.
